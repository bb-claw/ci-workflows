#
# Triggers a Railway service redeployment. Railway pulls the latest image
# from ghcr.io (the same digest built by docker-build-push.yml).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Railway service must be configured to use a Docker image source
#     pointing to ghcr.io/bb-claw/<service-name>
#   - RAILWAY_TOKEN secret must be scoped to the correct project + environment
#
# Inputs:
#   service-id    — Railway service ID (from Railway dashboard → service settings)
#   environment   — GitHub environment name ("dev" or "production")
